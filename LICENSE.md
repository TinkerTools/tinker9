The Academic License for Tinker9
================================

- Washington University in Saint Louis (WU)
- The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin)
- Sorbonne Université (Sorbonne)

1. On behalf of the Tinker developer community, an informal consortium of researchers
also known as the Tinker Core Development Consortium (**"TCDC"**) formed by Washington
University in Saint Louis (MO, USA), The University of Texas at Austin (TX, USA)
and Sorbonne Université (Paris, France) (collectively, TCDC-Members, individually
TCDC-Member), the TCDC-Members hereby grant to the **Licensee** (as identified in the
signature block below) a non-exclusive, nonsublicensable, non-transferable, revocable,
non-commercial license to use the object and source code versions of the software
known as "Tinker Software" and/or "Tinker9" (the **"Software"**), for internal academic purposes only,
including the right and license to incorporate improvements to the Software, for
a period of five (5) years subject to the terms and conditions below. All rights,
title, interest and copyright to the Software, to all portions thereof, and to any
associated documentation shall at all times remain the property of WU, UT Austin
and Sorbonne.

2. A member of the TCDC will provide access to the Software to the Licensee, which
may install the Software on a local network controlled by the Licensee's responsible
official and for the use by the Licensee in accordance with this Agreement. The Software
may be used beyond a local network or on a supercomputing center only if indicated
by the Licensee in the Research Purpose section below. The Licensee may not sublicense
the use of the Software, or make it available to third parties, without the prior
written consent of at least one TCDC-Member.

3. The Licensee accepts the Software "as is" and understands that it is experimental
in nature. The TCDC and TCDC-Members disclaim any and all representations and warranties,
expressed or implied, or statutory, of any kind or nature with respect to the Software,
including without limitation any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose or non-infringement of any third-party patent, copyright, or any third-party
right. The TCDC and all TCDC-Members, their trustees, faculty, staff, students
and agents, shall not be liable to Licensee, its successors, assigns, contractors
or sublicensees or any third party in any event for any damages or claims, whether
direct or indirect, special, consequential or incidental, arising from the use of
the Software.

4. Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TCDC and TCDC-Members,
their personnel, affiliates, and each of their respective trustees, faculty, staff,
employees, students, directors, officers, agents, successors and assigns (altogether
the "TCDC Indemnitees") from, for and against any and all judgments, settlements,
losses, expenses, damages and/or liabilities and any and all court costs, attorneys’
fees, and expert witness fees and expenses that a TCDC Indemnitee may incur from
any and all allegations, claims, suits, actions or proceedings (the "Claims") arising
out of, relating to, or incidental to Licensee’s breach of this Agreement or its
use, development, modification, or other exploitation of Software, whether by or
through Licensee, and including all Claims for infringement, injury to business,
personal injury, and product liability. The obligations set forth in this Section
shall survive termination of this Agreement, shall continue even after assignment
of rights and responsibilities, and shall not be limited by any provision of this
Agreement outside this Section.

5. The Licensee may create computer programs that incorporate or modify the Software
or resemble its structure, sequence or organization and may install and use such
modified programs on computers for which use of the Software is authorized as described
in Section 2. The Licensee may distribute binaries of the modified Software over
the public community Tinker web site (www.tinkertools.org). Licensee grants to the
TCDC and each TCDC-Member a non-exclusive license, with right to sub-license, to
any and all source code that is delivered to the TCDC for possible inclusion in further
releases of the Software.

6. The Licensee agrees, in perpetuity, not to disclose the Software to any third
party and to use it only for the purposes of this Agreement, unless the TCDC gives
prior written consent. In protecting the Software, the Licensee must use at least
the same degree of care it uses to protect its own computer programs and other confidential
information.

7. The user agrees that any reports or published results obtained with the Software
will acknowledge its use by the appropriate citation.
   - The main Tinker reference. Any published work which utilizes Tinker shall give
   appropriate acknowledgement to the Tinker 8 developer community's contribution by
   including the following main reference:
      > TINKER 8: A Modular Software Package for Molecular Design.
      > Joshua A. Rackers, Zhi Wang, Chao Lu, Marie L. Laury, Louis Lagardère,
      > Michael J. Schnieders, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pengyu Ren, Jay W. Ponder,
      > Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 14, 5273-5289, 2018,
      > DOI: [10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00529](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.8b00529)
   - The Tinker9 reference. Considering the use of Tinker9, any published work which
   utilizes Tinker9 shall give, in addition to the main Tinker reference, appropriate
   acknowledgement to the Tinker9 developer community's contribution by including the
   following reference:
      > Tinker9: Next Generation of Tinker with GPU Support,
      > Zhi Wang, Jay W. Ponder, 2021,
      > https://github.com/TinkerTools/tinker9

8. This license may be terminated upon twenty days’ notice for any breach of this
Agreement, provided that that breach has not been corrected prior to the expiry of
such notice.
